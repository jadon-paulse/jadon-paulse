I'm a QA engineer working on a Crop Health detection model. I provide detailed analysis and breakdowns to the engineering teams, improving the reliability of the model output.
In my spare time, I experiment with game development utilising Unreal Engine Blueprints, Godot's GDScript, and
I am also working with JavaScript/TypeScript and React to improve my Full-Stack development skills.<br/>

On a journey of continuous learning and improving my skills<br/>
